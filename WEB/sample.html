    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I'm a 3rd year student studying at <a href="#tufts">Tufts University</a>". While my focus is in computer science, I also have interests in Finance and Japanese. Outside of academics, I am involved in various sports. To name a few:
    <ul>
      <li>Tennis</li>
      <li>Soccer</li>
      <li>Pickleball</li>
    </ul>
    In the spring semester, I hope to study abroad in Japan where I will be staying in an apartment in Kyoto.
